Nbd7 7. Nc3 $6 Bxf3 {For some reason I had completely 
missed this opportunity.} 8. Bxf3 dxc4 9. dxc4 Ne5 {Now he 
will exchange my bishop on f3 which usually is pretty good 
but here it doesn't matter much and I still have a slight 
initative.} 10. Qa4 Nxf3+ 11. exf3 Qb6 12. a3 Be7 {It still 
remains a mystery to me why my opponent didn't just play 
12...Bc5 after which he can put his bishop on the nice d4 
square.} (12... Bc5 13. Qc2 Bd4 $11) 13. b4 Qd4 14. Qb3 O-O

thought that I maybe had a little advantage here but 
probably it's just equal.} a6 20. Na4 {I tried to use the 
just weakened b6 square.} b5 21. Nc3 (21. Nb6 $5 {Was the 
only move to hope for an advantage but during the game I 
was afraid that in the long run my knight could become out 
of play.}) 21... Rxd1 22. Rxd1 Rd8 23. Ne4 Rxd1 24. Qxd1 
{Here I was about to offer a draw after something like 
24...Nxe4 but my opponent now suddenly made a strange 
move.} bxc4 $2 (24... Nxe4 25. fxe4 Qd8 {Seems like a draw 
to me.}) 25. Nxf6+ Bxf6 26. Qc2 {I'm not sure what my 
opponent had missed because now he will just remain with a 
weak structure.} Qb7 (26... a5 {Maybe this was his plan.} 
27. Qxc4 axb4 28. Qxb4 {but now I have a very strong passed 
pawn which is not easy to stop.}) 27. Qxc4 h5 28. Qd3 g6

opportunity:} f5 (31... e4 $5 32. fxe4 c5 33. f3 c4 34. Bd4

34. h4 f4 {I am very close to winning here but I made a 
huge mistake here spoiling almost all of my advantage.}

43. b7 Be5 44. Kxf2 {[%cal Gf2e3,Gg5f4] Would be winning 
very easily.}) 35... Qe2 $2 {I don't know why my opponent 
didn't just take on a4. I thought I would win easily but 
for some reason black can just hang on.} (35... Qxa4 $1 
36. Be7 Qb3 37. Bg5+ Kh7 38. Bf6 Qg8 39. Bxe5 {During the 
game I thought i would win easily here but when you start 
thinking about it is not so easy at all.} fxg3 40. Kxg3 Kh6

black.}) 36. gxf4 $2 {One more time I make a mistake. I 
played this move immediately expecting my opponent would 
take back but I forgot he didn't have to take back!} 
(36. Qxc6 fxg3 37. Qe4 $1 Qb2 38. Qd3 $18 {And I should win 
without too much trouble.}) 36... e4 $1 {Suddenly black has
