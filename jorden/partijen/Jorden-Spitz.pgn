Bd7 9. Nce2 {I think that this is a bit of a strange move. The knight was well
placed on c3. My opponents plan was to strengthen his knight on d4 with c3 but
I don't see any real reason to do that. It was not attacked or something like
that.} Nf6 10. c3 Be7 11. f4 O-O {I think that I am already very much ok here
having developed all my pieces.} 12. h3 (12. Be3 Ng4 {Was a bit annoying so
white decides to play h3 first.}) 12... Rab8 13. Qd3 Rfe8 {Taking on d4
immediately is possible but I don't have anything after Nxd4.} (13... Nxd4 14.
Nxd4 e5 {Seems good but} 15. Nf5 {saves the day.} Bb5 16. Nxe7+ Qxe7 17. c4 {
And white is ok. That's why I decided to play 13...Rfe8 first. to take with
the rook on e7.}) 14. g4 $2 Nxd4 $1 {Now this is possible.} 15. cxd4 {Possibly
my opponent thought that he was ok here because of all his pawns in the center
but in reality I think that it are mainly weaknesses.} Bb5 16. Qe3 e5 $6 (16...
d5 $1 17. e5 Ne4 {Was much better. with my knight standing beautifully on e4
and Qc2 coming next.} 18. Bxe4 dxe4 19. Qxe4 {Seems to win a pawn but all the
white squares are now weakened in his camp and his king doesn't feel
very safe either.} Qc4 $17) 17. Rd1 {Now it is not so easy to continue.} h6 $6
{This move is just to slow and can even be a target for a white attack later
on with g5 later on.} (17... Rbc8 $15 {Is still slightly better for me
although my knight doesn't stand on the beautiful e4 square anymore and can be
kicked away with g5 at some point.}) (17... exf4 18. Nxf4 Bf8 {Was my initial
plan to put pressure on e4 but now g5 is quite annoying so I decided to play
17...h6 first.} (18... h6 $5 {h6 here is probably better then in the game.}))
18. Nc3 Bd7 19. Kh1 b5 {My initial plan of exf4 was probably better than the
text but for some reason I decided to change my plan and play b5.} (19... exf4

the white queen. I should have played b4 immediately.} (21... b4 $1 22. gxf6

wil just pick it up and I will be a pawn up.} 26. Qa3 Rxg2 $5 27. Kxg2 Qxe4+

white.}) 23... Nxd5 24. exd5 {During the game I thought that I should be
better here but it is not so easy as I thought and a few inaccurate moves
later I was about to get mated.} Bc5 (24... Bf5 {[%cal Gf5g6] Should be better
defending the king.}) 25. Qg3 Qb6 26. Be4 {White is already creating some
threats with Qh4 becoming possible and so on while black lacks any clear plan.
} Rbc8 27. Rf1 {This position is already very dangerous for black and around
here I started to realise it too.} g6 $2 (27... Qb5 $1 {Seems like a good move
intending to transfer the queen to the kingside with Qe2-Qh5.}) 28. Rf6 Qb5 29.

The only move to stay in the game.} (29... fxg6 30. Rxg6+ Kh7 31. Qf3 $1 {I
completely missed this move in my calculations. I am just getting mated here.}
