11. Bd4 Bxd4 12. Qxd4 Qg5+ 13. Kb1 Rd8 14. Bc4 Qxg2 {Lucas 
likes winning pawns but I dont think its a great idea here 
because his king will be in danger.} (14... c5 $5 {Is an 
interesting move although I think white willbe slightly 
better because of black weakened structure.}) 15. Bxd5 cxd5 
16. Rhg1 {Lucas obviously had hoped for 16.Nxd5 when he 
could take on d5 and in the end he would do a pin on my 
rooks unfortunately for him saw that so I decided to move 
my rook first.} (16. Nxd5 Rxd5 17. Qxd5 Qxd5 18. Rxd5 
Bb7 $11) 16... Qxh2 {This doesn't seem very good to me 
because the h-file will get opened.} (16... Qh3 $1 {Seemed 
like the only move to me.} 17. Nxd5 Be6 18. Ne7+ $1 
(18. Nf6+ Kh8 $1 {And white doesn't have a good discovered 
attack.} (18... Kf8 19. Qc5+ Kg7 20. Nh5+)) 18... Kf8 
19. Qf6 {And white is much better but it isn't that easy to 
win.}) (16... Qf3 17. Rd3 $1 Qf5 18. Nxd5 {[%cal Gd5e7]}) 
17. Rh1 {The rook returns but now the h-file is opened with 
blacks help!} c5 (17... Qg2 18. Qh4 $18) 18. Qf6 Qd6 
19. Nxd5 Kf8 {Lucas had seen enough of this game so I could 
checkmate him :)} 20. Qh8# *
