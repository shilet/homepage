{This is the game Browne-Van Kampen that I remembered and 
although Van Kampen won very easily white could have gotten 
a slight advantage at some point I remembered because I was 
watching the press conference of that game.} O-O $1 {This 
move is just a much better move then Van Kampen played.} 
(16... e5 {The move Van Kampen played.} 17. Qa4 Bc6 
18. Qc4 $1 {And I remembered that white a slight advantage 
here.} (18. Qxa6 {This is what browne played but this is 
very scary for white.})) 17. Qxd7 Qa5 $2 {My opponent could 
win with} (17... Bc5 $1 {and when the dark squared bishops 
get exchanged my king is very weak.} 18. Qd3 a5 $1 {and 
with a4 coming next white will just get mated probably.})

looking very strange when I played this move thinking I had 
just missed his move Rc4. But my move is actually very 
logical because I want to get to b3 with my king to 
eliminate the dangerous c3 pawn and then start running with 
my passed pawns.} Rc4 31. Kb3 Rxe4 32. Qc5 {I think that I 
might already be winning here because my passed pawns are 
so strong and he has no way to attack my king.} Qf4 33. a5

combined with the king is a strong team!} Qg1 38. Qc5 Qa1
