1. e4 {I decided to analyse a game I lost, as I thought those games were in
general a lot more interesting then the ones I won.} e6 $1 {The French
Defence! Not one of the openings I play usually, but mixing things up once in
a while can not do a lot of harm.} 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 {Unfortunately for me my
opponent didn't play his usual 3.Nd2, against which I had prepared something
more solid and better than what I played in this game.} Bb4 4. e5 Ne7 5. a3
Bxc3+ 6. bxc3 b6 {This was the line I had prepared. Probably the line is not
so good but a couple of my friends convinced me it's quite playable and I
thought for one game nothing can be too bad.} 7. Qg4 Ng6 {The idea for black
of course is to play ...Ba6 and try to exchange of the so called bad bishop,
but in return for that black has to put up a rather unstable defence on the
kingsside.} 8. h4 h5 9. Qg3 Ba6 10. Bxa6 Nxa6 11. Qd3 Nb8 12. Bg5 Qd7 13. Ne2
Nc6 14. Qf3 {The pawn on h5 is now quite a big target, and in order to defend
it I have to weaken my dark squares quite significantly.} Nge7 15. Nf4 g6 16.
Nh3 {I must confess that at this point I wasn't happy at all with my position.
White's got some very dangerous plans and my counterplay seems to be way too
slow. The computer however points out that black should be okay.} Ng8 {This
didn't feel right at all during the game, but I didn't see anything better.} (
16... Na5 17. Bf6 Rg8 18. Ng5 {this plan bothered me a lot. White just wants
to play Nh7 next when Bg5 followed by Nf6 is a huge threat. With some calm
moves however I could've defended against everything.} Nf5 19. Nh7 Qa4 20. Bg5
Rh8 21. Nf6+ Kf8 {And somehow I managed to save all my pieces just in time,
and also black suddenly has some counterplay himself.}) 17. O-O {After my last
move black luckily for me is still quite solid and it's not so easy to break
the black position.} Na5 18. a4 {A logical profylactical move against ...Qa4
which would be a juicy square for the black queen.} Nc4 (18... c5 19. dxc5 bxc5
) 19. Rfd1 a5 {I had the plan of winning the white pawn on a4 once, and then
my pawn on a5 is already a little closer to the promotion square.} (19... c5 {
this is a typical form of counterplay in this position for black, but here it
seemed way to early for me.} 20. dxc5 $1 {opening up the position.} bxc5 21.
Nf4 {And here white has so many threats that the position might already be
lost for black.}) 20. Qf4 Nb2 21. Re1 $1 Nc4 {I have to retreat my knight, but
it's actually not so easy for white to do something.} (21... Nxa4 {this wins a
pawn, but black won't be happy about it after 22.c4 which opens up the
position and leaves black already hopeless against all the threats.} 22. c4)
22. Ra2 Rb8 {I wanted to play ...b5 at some point and try to create some
counterplay with my a-pawn. For white it's quite obvious that he has to do
something on the kingsside. There are probably two plans to do so. The first
one is to switch the rook from e1 over to f3 and try to do something then, my
opponent however chose the other one.} 23. f3 {With this move white wants to
play g2-g4 at some point and open up the kingsside.} Rh7 {I am not quite sure
anymore why I played this move. My best guess is that I wanted to have f7
protected in case the f-file opens.} (23... b5 24. axb5 Rxb5) 24. g4 b5 $6 {
This is too impatient. I felt that I had to create some counterplay, but in
fact I am just weakening my position and especially the   c5 square right now.}
(24... Qc6) 25. axb5 Rxb5 26. Qg3 c5 27. gxh5 $6 {My opponent also does not
play  in the most precise way. The natural 27.Nf4 would have been better, with
the knight heading for d3 and later on c5.} Rxh5 28. Nf4 {The white knight can
still go to d3 but actually here I got some play myself too. The f5 square for
example is a very nice target for my knight on g8.} Rh8 29. h5 gxh5 30. Kf2 $6
{My opponent told me after the game that his inital intention was to play 30.
Bf6, but only noticed her that my rook got acces to the f8 square. 30.Kf2
however is also not the best move. It seems like a very natural move by white,
but actually the white king is quite vulnerable here.} (30. Bf6 Nxf6 31. Qg7
Rg8 (31... Rf8 32. exf6 Qd6 $15) 32. exf6 {this was my opponents nice idea,
but 31...Rf8 spoils the fun for white.}) (30. Raa1 $1 {brining the clumsy rook
back into would probably have been the best move.}) 30... cxd4 31. cxd4 Qa7 {
At this point during the game I was very content with my position, and the
computer actually gives me a large advantage, but still the position is very
sharp and a single mistake could give the advantage to white.} 32. c3 Ne7 33.
Qh3 h4 $2 {This is just a blunder, giving all of my advantage away.} (33... Nf5
$1 {would have been extremely strong, and actually the computer points out
that black might already be winning here. During the game however I hardly
considered this move as I thought that after 34.Nxh5, 35.Nf6+ would be a hard
threat to deal with.} 34. Nxh5 Kf8 $1 {this is a very strong move. The king
feels unsafe here, but actually if white does not give mate his pieces are out
of play on the kingsside and it will be black's turn to try and give mate.} 35.
Bf6 Rh7 36. Qg4 Qb6 $1 {At the next move the black rook comes to b2 with
decisive effects.}) 34. Bf6 {Now the position is balanced again.} Rg8 35. Qxh4
Rb3 36. Ne2 Nf5 37. Qh7 Rf8 38. Rg1 $6 {38.Bg7 would have been better but it's
a very strange move to my eye.} Kd7 39. Rg5 Qb6 $2 {Now the white exchange
sacrifice is very strong. The simple 39. ..Kc6 or even 39...Nce3 would've
prevented it.} (39... Nce3 {with the nasty idea of playing ...Rb1.}) (39... Kc6
40. Rxf5 exf5 41. Qxf5 Qd7 {and compared to the game the black king is much
safer and white does not have much for the exchange.}) 40. Rxf5 exf5 41. Qxf5+
Qe6 42. Qh7 {I had missed this simple move when I went for 39...Qb6. Now 43.
Nf4 seems to be a very annoying idea of white.} Qb6 $6 {I played this as I was
too afraid of Nf4 coming with tempo when I thought my position would get very
dangerous, but as my computer points out black is more than fine after 42...
Kc6.} (42... Kc6 43. Nf4 Qd7 $15) 43. Qg7 Ke8 $2 {I completely missed white's
idea. I only considered the ugly 43...Qb8 for a couple of seconds...} 44. Ra1
Qb8 {to play it one move later anyway!} (44... Rb2 {was obviously the move I
had planned, but it was only here that I noticed that after} 45. Rh1 Rxe2+ {
chess is not checkers and that white does not have to recapture!} 46. Kg3 {
Black has run out of checks while 47.Qxf8 and if 47...Kxf8 48.Rh8# is
impossible to prevent.}) 45. Rh1 $6 (45. Bg5 $1 {with the plan of playing 46.
Bh6 would've been very hard to deal with.}) 45... Kd7 {This was the idea
behind 44...Qb8, now my rook is protected and I can try to go for the escape
with my king.} 46. e6+ {The computer points out that here I could've taken on
e6. I did not see the refutation of it during my game, but was too afraid to
take it anyway.} Kc6 47. Be5 $2 {Suddenly my opponent also falters. 47.e7
would've been the normal move, but things are not so clear after it.} (47. e7
Rg8 48. Qxf7 Nd6 {and the position is just very hard to judge. The white
passed pawn is not so dangerous as it looks, while my king has found relative
safety.}) (47. exf7 Nd6 {is okay for black.}) 47... Nxe5 $2 {I did not expect
at all that I might have had a winning opportunity, but in actuality I did!} (
47... Qe8 $1 {I only considered this move very briefly, but felt it should be
too passive. The truth is however that white does not seem to have any real
continuation of his attack and that black with his extra material is winning.}
48. Rh7 fxe6 49. Qc7+ Kb5 50. Qc5+ Ka4 {and the black king feels as if it is
at home on a4 :)}) 48. dxe5 Rb2 {Nd4+ was a huge threat, so of course I have
to prevent it.} 49. exf7 Qa7+ 50. Kg3 Qxf7 {Unfortunately I have to go for an
ending which is drawable but still very dangerous.} (50... Rxf7 $2 51. Qg6+ Kc5
52. Qd6+ Kc4 53. Qc6+ Kd3 54. Nc1+ $1 Kd2 55. Qxd5+ Kxc3 56. Qc5+ Kd2 57. Rh2+
{leads to mate.}) 51. Nd4+ Kb7 52. Qxf7+ Rxf7 53. e6 Rf8 $1 {It is important
to keep the white king cut off.} 54. f4 a4 55. Ra1 Ra8 $2 {Finally I make the
desicive mistake. I hoped that I could create enough counterplay with my
passed a-pawn, but I should have realized that this would never had been the
case.  Rather, I should have gone for active counterplay and try to harass the
white king.} (55... Rg8+ 56. Kf3 Rbg2 $1 57. f5 (57. Nf5 Rc2) 57... Kc7 $1 {
The point behind black's play. The black king rushes to e5 which is
surprisingly hard to prevent. I actually saw this idea during the game but
just could not quite believe it.} 58. f6 (58. Rxa4 Kd6 59. Ke3 Ke5 $1 60. Nc6+
Kf6 $11) 58... Kd6 59. f7 R8g3+ 60. Kf4 Rg4+ 61. Ke3 R2g3+ 62. Nf3 Ke7 $11) 56.
f5 {Now the white pawns are just too strong.} Kc7 57. f6 Kd6 58. Re1 $1 {A
final accurate move. Nf5 followed by pushing the pawns is now unstoppable.}
Rbb8 59. Nf5+ Kc6 60. e7 Kd7 61. f7 a3 62. Ng7 {A game with a lot of mistakes,
but also very interesting and something to learn from!} 1-0
