game I wasn't sure anymore what was the main line in this position.(Qd8 or Bd8)
I played 17...Bd8 because for some reason i thought that it looked like a
funny move.} 18. e5 {White opens the position immediately. 18.Ne3 also seems
interesting.} dxe5 19. Bxe5 Qc5 {I thought for a long time here because I
wasn't sure where to put the queen. 18...Qc6  looked like the most logical
move but for some reason I was a little worried about moves like Be4 at some
point. I also liked that the queen on c5 can go back to the kingside if needed.

variations black looks ok.} 21. Bxc7 (21. fxe6 Rxe6 22. Bxc7 (22. Rxf6 Rxe5 $19

winning chances! After this move the white queen can get trapped and my bishop on
b7 becomes very strong!} (22... Nh5 23. Be2 {I didn't like.}) 23. cxd3 Nh5 {
Now the white queen is trapped and all that remains is to attack it. My plan
is f6 and then go Be7-f8.} 24. d4 Qc6 (24... Qe7 {This interesting move was suggested by my opponent after the game. 
Although probably it is not that good, I even didn't look at it during the game. Black wants to go Qh4 and then play Ng3+
winning the queen.} 25. Kg1 f6 {traps the bishop and black seems to be much
better but} (25... Qh4 26. g4 {now doesn't work.}) 26. f5 $1 {And suddenly
blacks king doesn't feel very safe.} fxe5 (26... Qg7 27. Qxg7+ Nxg7 28. Bd6 {
And the bishop escapes with a slightly better endgame for white.}) 27. fxg6 Nf4

here white is much better.}) 25. d5 {White tries to shut down my bishop at the
cost of a pawn.} exd5 26. Bd4 Re4 27. Rd1 Be7 {Now the white queen is starting
to get into real trouble so white has to take measures to safe it.} 28. Nf5 Bf8

coordinating great.} Qc2 31. Ne3 Qb3 $2 {A mistake in time trouble.} (31... Qa4

gets a winning attack.} Be7 {is what I thought during the game only
calculating Nxf6.} 33. Bxf6 $1 (33. Nxf6+ $2 Bxf6 34. Bxf6 Rxf4 {and suddenly

35. Rfe1 b4 $6 {I'm not sure if this is a great move because it allows white to
get active play over the a file on the other hand now the black bishop  can
join the action with Ba6-d3.} 36. axb4 axb4 37. b3 Ba6 38. Bb6 Bd3 39. Nd4

of. Still my passed f-pawn should be very strong and I think that with
accurate play I should be able to hold the balance.} f3 48. h4 $6 {Allowing
the black knight to transfer to a better square also exchanging pawns what can
only be favourable for the defender.} gxh4 49. gxh4 Nf4 50. Ra1 Ng6 51. h5 Ne5
