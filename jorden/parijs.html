From 12-19 April I played a tournament in Paris and also this time my brother Lucas took part.
I went there with my grandparents which was very nice of them. I had already been a few times to Paris before and I even played in this tournament 2 years ago. 
My grandmother is a very good cook, and we always joked that we were having food from a 3 stars restaurant.
My grandfather is very sick and gets tired quickly so we didn't see much of the city but I already had been to Paris 3 times before so I had already seen most of the city.
<br></br>
In the first round I played a draw against Fro Trommsdorf (2024). I was much better in an ending and I decided to go for the winning plan only at the wrong time. 
Now my opponent tricked me and won a pawn after which the game ended in a draw. This wasn't a very good start but in the next 2 rounds I managed to fight back and won 2 times in a row.
<br>

<br>
I was black against Patrick Siptz(2156)

  }  
);

In the fourth round I played against Maxim L Devereaux (2337) and in an equal endgame I made a huge blunder.
</br>
<br></br>

	<br><br></i>
<span style="font-style: straight;"> 


After that I had to start all over again with my tournament, happily I won the next three games in a row.	
<br></br>
In the 8th ground I finally played against a higher rated opponent (Shchkaevecvhc) (2527). I was slightly better throughout the whole game but I didn't see a way to increase my advantage.
Eventually the game ended in a draw.
<br></br>
In the 9th and final round I played against Zinchenko(2532) with the black pieces.  If I managed to win I would obtain my last IM norm. Unfortunately I didn't manage to win but it was still a very interesting game:
<script> 
new PgnViewer(  
	{
	pgnFile: './partijen/Zinchenko-Jorden.pgn',  
	boardName: "kasparov",  
    pieceSize: 46  
  }  
);  
</script> 
<div id="kasparov-container"></div>  
<div id="kasparov-moves"></div>  
<br></br>
<br></br>
It was a nice tournament and I enjoyed it very much!
